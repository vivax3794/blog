Hey! I am just me :P

I am just a hobby programmer, I love talking about programming, but rarely have anybody to talk to... so blog time!

I mainly use Rust and TypeScript, but I also use Python for quick prototypes. Also, I am terrible at finishing projects xD

Don't expect this blog to be anything high quality, I will just write about what I like, everything from in-depth explanations of whatever I was thinking about that day to very minimal and short rants about topics :P
