## Intro

So this is from my own experience hosting webpages, I won't claim to have all the best answers, and these aren't the best answers. This is how I have decided to set up my tech stack, and there are many other options out there.

So web hosting is how you get your website on the web. You might have made your amazing website, but currently, it is only on `localhost`? Then this post might be of help!

I will touch on how this site itself is hosted, how I am hosting my [3D printer site](https://printer.vivax3794.com); focusing mainly on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

Also, this won't be a tutorial, it will explain how I have stuff set up, and link to relevant resources!

## DNS

So what is [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dns)? DNS is basically how the web knows how to get to your webpage, when you enter `blog.vivax3794.com` your browser sends a request to a bunch of DNS servers to know where to find the website. 

Without DNS we would need to always input IP addresses, but we would also need a lot more of them. Why you ask? Well when you go to a domain you tell the server what domain you are going to, you can almost imagine the server you are contacting looks like:
```python
if request.domain == "blog.vivax3794.com":
    serve("blog.html")
elif request.domain = "printer.vivax3794.com":
    serve("printer.html")
```

so both those domains would be hosted on the same IP, but to you, they look like different web pages.

I would personally recommend using [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/), they have a lot of nice integrations that I will get to later. Easiest to also buy the domain via Cloudflare, but if you already have a domain don't worry you can [switch your DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#change-your-nameservers-full-setup), to Cloudflare for free.

Cloudflare DNS does proxying, meaning that even if you point the DNS to your IP requests will be routed via Cloudflare and your IP remains private. (Although don't do this, see the [Backend](#backend) section for a better way!)

## Frontend

So frontend, this is the easiest to host, there are a lot of **free** options out there (and they aren't scams!). The most widely known one is GitHub Pages.

### Vanilla

> With vanila, I mean just pure html/css/js, i.e no preprocessing needed.

Here there are many options, the easiest being [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)! You might already have your files in a git repo, in that case, all you have to do is enable Github Pages in your repo settings and in a few minutes you are up and running.

GitHub will even give you a free domain, `username.github.io/repo` like you can find this website at <https://vivax3794.github.io/blog> (it will redirect back to this domain). But you can also set up a [custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) like I have, and it is also very simple, and with Cloudflare, you get a free SSL certificate as well! 

### Generated

Now what if you are one of those fancy people and want to use component libraries, and frameworks, or generate your site from markdown (like this blog!)

#### GitHub Actions

You can build your page using [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [upload](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow) the resulting files to Github Pages, you can have it set to build on each push making pushing updates easy!

#### Cloudflare Pages

An alternative is [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), which is very similar to GitHub Actions, but it is contained within Cloudflare and as such makes it easy to connect it to your custom domain. You connect it to your Github Repo (or other sites) and it builds on push similar to Github Actions. you also get a free domain from them at `project.pages.dev`, like <https://vivax3794-main-page.pages.dev/> (which is tied to <https://vivax3794.com>)

#### Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a site generation tool, it is what this blog uses. I won't go into details about it as it falls under the same banner as the two last ones. The reason I mention it is that GitHub Pages has [native support](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) for it, making it really easy to use with GitHub pages (and this is how this blog is done).

## Backend

Now what if you need a backend (or you are one of those people that use [SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_rendering))? Well, that gets harder, and to be completely honest I don't have any experience on this point. The search term you wanna use is _VPS_ 

What I will say is that I am running an [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/) locally on a Raspberry Pi, it needs to run locally so no way around it. So how do I do this? Did I just point the DNS to my IP? well No, that would be a terrible idea!

What I do is use [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/), it is a form of reverse proxy, so my system connects the Cloudflare, then Cloudflare sends web requests via that socket, no need to open up ports in your firewall, or reveal your IP. It also lets you add access limitations, like only you can access the webpage, meaning that unauthorized traffic won't even hit your local network!
